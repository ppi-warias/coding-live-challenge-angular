# AngularChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Coding Challenge Steps

### Coding Challenge: Building a Todo Application with NgRx, Angular Components, Reactive Forms, Directives, and RxJS
#### Objective:
Create a Todo application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. The application should use NgRx for state management, Angular components for UI, Angular Reactive Forms for form handling, custom directives for UI enhancements, and RxJS for reactive programming patterns.

#### Requirements:
**NgRx Store:**

Set up NgRx store to manage the state of the todo list.
Create actions, reducers, and selectors for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks.

**Angular Components:**

Create a main TodoComponent to display the list of tasks.
Create a TodoFormComponent for adding and editing tasks.
Create a TodoFilterComponent for filtering tasks.
Angular Reactive Forms:

Use Reactive Forms in TodoFormComponent to handle task input.
Validate the form to ensure tasks have a title.
Angular Directives:

Create a custom directive to highlight overdue tasks.
RxJS Patterns:

Use RxJS operators to handle asynchronous operations and state changes.
